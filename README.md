## 🚀 What You’ll Build

DeskTimer is a **Mixed Reality timer** that lives inside your real room.  
With this project, you’ll learn how to:

- 🧱 **Spawn 3D timers** as floating objects in your space  
- ✋ **Grab and move them** anywhere—just like real objects  
- 🧭 **Attach live UI panels** with real-time countdowns  
- 🔊 **Play spatial audio** when timers start and finish  
- 😴 **Configure and snooze timers** with a floating panel  
- 🗑 **Delete timers** using a universal floating delete button  
- 🎨 **Customize timer colors & snooze duration** from a Compose menu  
- 🧩 Use **ECS components and systems** to drive logic cleanly  
- 🛠 **Edit scenes** using the Meta Spatial Editor  
- 📦 Build modular, scalable Mixed Reality tools from scratch  

By the end, you’ll have a fully interactive MR tool that feels like part of your environment—not just another app.
